# In-Depth Analysis: People, PGs & Services

**Generated from current Tracker + USA report.**  
This document gives a full breakdown, risk view, and concrete recommendations.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

| Metric | Count | Meaning |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **People** (assigned to PGs in Tracker) | 67 | Who is doing PG work today |
| **PGs** (in scope, we send sheets) | 70 | Total PGs we serve |
| **PGs with NO owner** | 37 | **Critical:** No one assigned in Tracker – must assign |
| **PGs with owner but at risk / low score** | 33 | Have owners but need reinforced support |
| **People with capacity** (≤1 PG) | 18 | Can take on more PGs (e.g. to cover the 37) |

**Top 3 findings**

1. **53% of PGs (37/70) have no one assigned** in the Tracker. Until owners are assigned, services for these PGs are not clearly owned.
2. **All 70 PGs are in “gap”** (no allocation or at risk/low score). Every PG needs at least one action: either assign owner(s) or reinforce support.
3. **18 people have capacity** (≤1 PG). They are the main pool to assign to the 37 PGs with no allocation; some can take 2 PGs each to close the gap.

---

## 2. Breakdown by Division

PGs are spread across **EAST**, **CENTRAL**, **WEST**, and **EAST CENTRAL**. Below: how many PGs per division, how many have no owner, and how many are at risk.

| Division | PGs (total) | No owner | Have owner (at risk/low score) |
|----------|-------------|----------|--------------------------------|
| CENTRAL | 35 | 24 | 11 |
| EAST | 15 | 2 | 13 |
| EAST CENTRAL | 4 | 1 | 3 |
| WEST | 10 | 2 | 8 |

**Insight:** **CENTRAL** has the largest gap: 24 PGs with no owner and 11 with owners but at risk/low score. Prioritise assigning owners in CENTRAL first, then reinforce EAST/WEST/EAST CENTRAL where owners exist but scores are low.

---

## 3. Breakdown by Health Status

| Health status | PGs | Note |
|---------------|-----|------|
| at risk | 24 | Need focused support / catch-up |
| Fair | 18 | Need improvement |
| very disappointment | 6 | Urgent: ACO Health, Boerne, COFMC, Healthfirst, Royal VP, Visiting Practitioners |
| Good | 14 | Stable but many still have latest score 0 – need catch-up on delivery |
| might loose very less activity | 4 | Monitor closely |
| not called | 1 | Orthopaedic Associates LLC |

**Insight:** **6 PGs** are “very disappointment” – these should get **immediate** attention (owner + backup if single-owner, or reinforced support and timeline).

---

## 4. Risk Analysis

### 4.1 Single-owner PGs (backup risk)

These PGs have **only one person** in the Tracker. If that person is unavailable, the PG has no backup.

| PG | Owner | Health | Latest score |
|----|-------|--------|--------------|
| ACO Health | Rupashi | very disappointment | 0 |
| Atrium Housecalls | Soumyadiya | at risk | 0 |
| Best Self | Adika | at risk | 0 |
| Covenant Care | Rupashi | Good | 0 |
| Diverse care clinic | Celine | Fair | 0 |
| Intracare | Chaitanya | Fair | 0 |
| Optimized Mobile Practitioners | Manasvi | very disappointment | – |
| Paragon | Yukta | very disappointment | 0 |
| Rocky Mountain | Yukta | Fair | 0 |

**Recommendation:** Add a **backup owner** for each of these, or at least for ACO Health, Optimized Mobile Practitioners, and Paragon (very disappointment).

### 4.2 High-workload people (10+ PGs)

These people carry the most PGs; they are at higher risk of not catching up if capacity is stretched.

| Person | PG count | Sample PGs |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Javeriya | 15 | housecall MD, Grace at Home, Hyde Park, community first, … |
| Manasvi | 15 | housecall MD, Grace at Home, Royal VP, optimized, … |
| Tiisetso | 13 | housecall MD, Grace at Home, Hyde Park, new bedford, … |
| Priti | 13 | housecall MD, Grace at Home, bloom, rocky mountain, … |
| Devleena | 12 | housecall MD, Grace at Home, Hyde Park, paragon, … |
| Madhur | 11 | housecall MD, Grace at Home, Hyde Park, paragon, … |
| Sukhman | 11 | housecall MD, healthfirst, new bedford, riverside, … |
| Ananya | 10 | housecall MD, Grace at Home, Hyde Park, paragon, … |
| John Mithi | 10 | housecall MD, Grace at Home, Hyde Park, paragon, … |
| Johnathan | 10 | housecall MD, Grace at Home, Hyde Park, paragon, … |
| Sowjanya | 10 | housecall MD, Grace at Home, Hyde Park, paragon, … |
| Sutiksha | 10 | housecall MD, Grace at Home, Hyde Park, paragon, … |
| Suzanne | 10 | housecall MD, Grace at Home, Hyde Park, paragon, … |

**Recommendation:** Avoid adding more PGs to these 13 people until the 37 unassigned PGs are covered by others. Use “people with capacity” for new assignments.

### 4.3 PGs with “very disappointment” status

| PG | Current owner(s) | Single owner? |
|----|------------------|---------------|
| ACO Health | Rupashi | Yes |
| Boerne Healthcare Group | (none) | – |
| COFMC | Hiya, Mona | No |
| Healthfirst | Adrika, Sukhman | No |
| Royal VP | 12 people | No |
| Visiting Practitioners And Palliative Care LLC | (none) | – |
| Optimized Mobile Practitioners | Manasvi | Yes |

**Recommendation:**  
- **Assign owners** to Boerne Healthcare Group and Visiting Practitioners (Priority 1).  
- **Reinforce** ACO Health (add backup), COFMC, Healthfirst, Royal VP, Optimized Mobile Practitioners (owner + timeline for catch-up).

---

## 5. Capacity vs Demand

- **Demand:** 37 PGs need at least one owner.
- **Supply:** 18 people with capacity (≤1 PG each).

If each of the 18 takes **2 PGs**, that covers 36 PGs; one more PG can be assigned to someone taking a second PG or to a medium-workload person. So **assigning the 18 people with capacity to the 37 PGs is feasible** (some people take 2 PGs).

**People with capacity (candidates to assign):**

| Person | Current PG count | Current PG(s) |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| Aditya | 1 | grace at home |
| Adrika (Rework) | 1 | trucare medical |
| Annaya | 1 | hawthorn |
| Anushka | 1 | bloom |
| Cheruthan | 1 | grace at home |
| Divya | 1 | spectrum (community first primary care) |
| Farhaan | 1 | ttuhsc |
| Jonathan | 1 | spectrum (community first primary care) |
| Om | 1 | wound centrics |
| RSC | 1 | providence care |
| Richard | 1 | spectrum (community first primary care) |
| Sadhwika | 1 | hyde park oct to dec |
| Sahmika | 1 | rocky mountain nov dec |
| Shivani | 1 | norman regional |
| Shivi (Rework) | 1 | wound centrics |
| Simran | 1 | rocky mountain nov dec |
| Soumyadiya | 1 | atrium housecall |
| Suchitra | 1 | hawthorn |

**Recommendation:** Build an **assignment list**: map each of the 37 Priority 1 PGs to one of these 18 (or to a medium-workload person if needed). Prefer same division where possible (e.g. CENTRAL PGs → assignees who can support CENTRAL).

---

## 6. Priority 1: PGs with No Owner (37 total)

**Action:** Assign one (or two) owners from “people with capacity” or medium workload. Update the Tracker.

**List (by division):**

**CENTRAL (24):**  
Prime MD Geriatrics, Texas Infectious Disease Institute, APPLE MD, Anibal Avila MA P,C, Boerne Healthcare Group, Boyer family practice, CPG - Community Physician Group, Centrics physician group, Chickasaw Nation Medical Center, Clinics of north texas, Crescent Infectious Diseases, Doctor at your service, Doctors at Home, Goldstein Alasdair MD, Internal Medicine Associates OKC, KELLUM FAMILY PRACTICE, Los Cerros, Northeast ProHealth, Orthopaedic Specialists of Massachusetts, Primary care of Ada, Responsive Infectious Diseases Solutions, Restore Family Medical clinic, San Antonio Family Physicians, Southeast Oklahoma Medical Clinic, TPCH Practice, Total Family Healthcare, Triton Health PLLC, Visiting Practitioners And Palliative Care LLC, WoundCentrics LLC, family medical associates, ortho central, ssm health bone & joint hospital, SSM Health shawnee.

**EAST (2):** MDPC, Prima Care.

**WEST (2):** Jo Wyatt, Orthopaedic Associates LLC (not called, score 1.0).

**EAST CENTRAL (1):** MDPC.

*(Full list: open `output/catch_up_plan.csv` and filter Priority = 1. Division from `output/pg_summary.csv` column divisional_group.)*

**Recommendation:** Start with CENTRAL (most no-owner PGs). Assign 12–18 people from capacity list to these PGs (each taking 1–2 PGs). Then assign EAST, WEST, EAST CENTRAL.

---

## 7. Priority 2: Reinforce Support (33 PGs)

These PGs **have owners** but are at risk or have low/zero latest score. Actions:

- **Add backup owner** for single-owner PGs (see section 4.1).
- **Set catch-up timeline** (e.g. “Latest score to 1 by [date]”) for each at-risk PG.
- **Focus “very disappointment”** PGs first: ACO Health, COFMC, Healthfirst, Royal VP, Optimized Mobile Practitioners, and (once assigned) Boerne, Visiting Practitioners.

No need to reassign primary owner unless they are overloaded; add backup and monitor score trend.

---

## 8. Score Trend

- Most PGs show **Improving** (recent scores vs older); a few show **Stable**.
- **Improving** with **latest score 0** means we are not yet “caught up” for that month – delivery still due or in progress. Keep owners and timelines in place until latest score = 1 where expected.

---

## 9. Recommended Action Plan (Summary)

| Step | Action | Owner |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Assign owners to all **37 Priority 1 PGs** using the 18 people with capacity (each can take 1–2 PGs). Start with CENTRAL (24). | You / ops lead |
| 2 | Add **backup owners** for the 9 single-owner PGs (especially ACO Health, Paragon, Optimized Mobile Practitioners). | You / ops lead |
| 3 | For **6 “very disappointment”** PGs: confirm owner + backup, set catch-up date, and review in 2 weeks. | You / ops lead |
| 4 | **Do not** add new PGs to the 13 high-workload people until the 37 are assigned and stable. | You / ops lead |
| 5 | **Update Tracker** after each assignment; re-run `python analysis.py` weekly to track “PGs with NO allocation” (target 0) and “at risk” count. | You / ops lead |
