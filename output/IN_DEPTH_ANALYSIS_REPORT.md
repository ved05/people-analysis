# Complete In-Depth Analysis: People & PG Services

---

## 1. Executive Summary

- **People** (with at least one PG, from Tracker): **67**
- **PGs** (in scope, we send sheets): **70**
- **PGs with NO allocation:** **37** – need owner(s) assigned.
- **PGs with gap** (at risk or low score but have owners): **33** – need reinforced support.
- **People with capacity** (<= 1 PG(s)): **18** – can take on more PGs.

**Bottom line:** Assign owners to PGs with no allocation; use people with capacity. Reinforce support for at-risk PGs.
